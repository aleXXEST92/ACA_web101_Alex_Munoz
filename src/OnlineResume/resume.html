                    <p>I am interested in learning to code so I may access new opportunities and
                    expand career options for myself. I look forward to entering the not only
                    exciting but high demand field of Web Development and Software
                    Programming. I am drawn to studying and achieving my goal of applying as
                    a new web developer in Austin. I plan to promote the new technology skills
                    that I learn from Austin Coding Academy and apply them to better my
                    future.</p>
